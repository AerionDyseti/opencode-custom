description: Generates a session summary (until memory is working).

You are about to perform a session reboot. This means generating a comprehensive handoff summary that will allow seamless continuation in a fresh context window.

Please create a detailed session summary that includes:

## 🎯 Session Overview

- **Primary Goal/Task**: What we were working on
- **Current Status**: Where we left off and what stage we're at

## 🧠 Key Learnings & Insights

- Important discoveries made during this session
- Technical insights or "aha moments"
- Any patterns or issues identified

## 🏗️ Decisions Made

- Architectural or design decisions
- Technology choices and rationale
- Implementation approaches chosen and why

## ✅ Progress Accomplished

- Features/components completed
- Files created or modified (with key changes)
- Tests written or configurations set up

## 🔄 Current Context

- **Working Directory**: Current project structure
- **Key Files**: Most important files and their current state
- **Dependencies**: Libraries, tools, or external services involved
- **Environment**: Any specific setup or configuration details

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Immediate next actions to take
- Specific tasks or features to implement
- Any blockers or considerations for next session

## 💾 Session Artifacts

- Code snippets that should be preserved
- Configuration details
- Commands or scripts that were useful
- Any URLs, documentation, or resources referenced

## 🔧 Working Memory

- Variable names, function signatures, or conventions established
- Debugging approaches that worked/didn't work
- Performance considerations or optimization notes

**REBOOT INSTRUCTIONS FOR NEXT SESSION:**
Format the above as a self-contained prompt that would give a fresh agent session everything needed to continue seamlessly. Include specific file paths, code examples, and enough context that no previous conversation history is needed.

After generating this summary:

1. ✋ **WAIT** - Let me review the summary before proceeding
2. Once the user has reviewed and accepted the summary, store the handoff in a CONTINUE.md file in the root directory, overwriting any existing content that is already there.
